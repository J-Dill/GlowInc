# Glow Inc.
Glow Inc. is all about giving more uses to the glow ink sacs products by glow squids, along with providing other ink-related fun.

## Features

### **Glow Ball**
#### Uses
When right-clicked, the glow ball can be thrown to create a luminescent splat across a full surface it hits. The projectile ignores water, leaving it to be a great underwater exploration tool.

In addition, when the ball hits a living entity, it will add the Glowing effect to them.

#### Crafting
The default recipe for the Glow Ball returns 8 of them and requires two Glow Ink sacs in shapeless crafting:

* Default: _false_

* Default: _20_ minutes
* Range: _1 - 120_ minutes

### **Pure Glow Bottle**
*Ingredients*: Brewing recipe with Glow Ink Sac and Water Bottles
