# Glow Inc.
Glow Inc. is all about giving more uses to the glow ink sacs products by glow squids, along with providing other ink-related fun.

## **Glow Ball**
### Uses
When right-clicked, the glow ball can be thrown to create a luminescent splat across a full surface it hits. 

The projectile ignores water and the splat it leaves behind is much brighter in water, making it a great underwater exploration tool.

In addition, when the ball hits a living entity, it will add the Glowing effect to them.

### Crafting
The default recipe for the Glow Ball returns 8 of them and requires two Glow Ink sacs in shapeless crafting:

## **Ink Gun**
### Uses
The Ink Gun is used to shoot Glow Ink even further than you can throw it and will hold up to 64 shots. (1 shot = 100mb)

### Loading
Pure Glow Bottles are how you refill the Ink Gun; when combined in a crafting grid each bottle will yield 400mb of ink.

Alternatively, you can also shift-click the Ink Gun with Pure Glow Bottles in your inventory and they will be used to
refill the Ink Gun, while returning the empty bottles to you.

### Crafting
*Ingredients*: 4 Iron, 1 Copper, and a bucket.
