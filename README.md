# Glow Inc.
Glow Inc. is all about giving more uses to the glow ink sacs products by glow squids, along with providing other ink-related fun.

## Features

#### Uses
When right-clicked, the glow ball can be thrown to create a luminescent splat across a full surface it hits. The projectile ignores water, leaving it to be a great underwater exploration tool.

In addition, when the ball hits a living entity, it will add the Glowing effect to them.

### **Pure Glow Bottle**
*Ingredients*: Brewing recipe with Glow Ink Sac and Water Bottles

## Future Plans
More ink-related shenanigans, of course, including Glow Ink Fluid and an Ink Gun.
